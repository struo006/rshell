rshell project

>This is the rshell project.

>Unfortunately we were unable to complete this assignment. We were unable to get commands with comments, ands, and ors working. However we managed to complete single commands, command with comments, the exit command, and
>username login information working.

>For the additions of test and parentheses, we were only able to successfully complete test for single cases. Unforunately we could not include parentheses in our new assignment.
>Some known bugs include:
	1. making a directoy with a comment at the end takes off the lass character of the directory name
	2. when echoing with a #inside of quotation marks delets everything after the #
	3. commands with exit and the end do not work
	4. for test, when there is no space between the flag and argument, it would still take in the argument instead of having errors
