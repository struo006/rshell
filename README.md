>This is the rshell project.

>Unfortunately we were unable to complete this assignment. We were unable to get commands with comments, ands, and ors workin>g. However we managed to complete single commands, command with comments, the exit command, and
>username login information working.

>Some known bugs include:
	1. making a directoy with a comment at the end takes off the lass character of the directory name
	2. when echoing with a #inside of quotation marks delets everything after the #
	3. commands with exit and the end do not work
